It allows controlling color range and reset modifications. It applies a solid fill pattern., Element.OverrideColorInViewFull - This node modifies the visualization of the elements in the active view by selecting color and fill pattern. Solid fill pattern will be applied by default., Element.ResetOverrides - This node modifies the visualization of the elements in the active view by selecting color and fill pattern. Solid fill pattern will be applied by default., Element.SelectInRevit - This node allows to select Revit elements using the element ID or the element itself., FloorPlanView.ByLevelAndViewTemplate - This node creates a new floor plan based on a level and a view template (selected by name)., Grid.FitToCropView - This node fit the grids to the crop view on the selected views., Grid.SetElevation - This node allows to modify grids at Z axis dimension, by selecting 2 levels and an offset., Help.AboutUs - This node links you to our web site., List.FirstLastItem - This node gets the first, last, all but first and all but last elements in a list., List.Rider - This node gets the combination of two lists, by mixing all the elements of the list without the first element and without the last element., MEP.ChangeFittingLevel - This node allows to change the level of a pipe or a duct fitting, without modifying the position., PerspectiveView.ByPoints - This node creates a new perspective view given its camera location, targets location and name., Point.SimilarityBetweenPoints - This node checks if two points are similar with an absolute tolerance., Room.CenterLocation - This node moves the room location of the selected rooms to the closest possible point to geometrical center., Room.CenterLocationAndTags - This node moves the room location of the selected rooms to the closest possible point to geometrical center.
