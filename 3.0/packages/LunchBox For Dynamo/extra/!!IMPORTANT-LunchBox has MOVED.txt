Dear Dynamo User,
Due to persistent issues we are encountering with the Dynamo package manager, we no longer believe the package manager is the best way of distributing LunchBox to Dynamo users.

We have combined LunchBox for Dynamo and Grasshopper into a single ClickOnce installer that is available on the Proving Ground website: https://provingground.io/tools/lunchbox/

We hope you enjoy LunchBox!

Sincerely,
The Proving Ground Team
