Keep in mind that OpenNURBS has limited ability to expose Ellipse and Circle methods so not all \"circles\" will be able to pass this node., RH Ellipse to DS Ellipse - This node converts rhino's open nurbs ellipse (nurbs curve) into design script's ellipse., RH Extrusion to DS Polysurface - This node will convert Rhino extrusion to Design Script polysurface., RH Geometry to DS Geometry - This node will translate all of the compatible Rhino geometry into its equivalent in Design Script., RH Line to DS Line - Converts Rhino Lines to Design Script Lines, RH Mesh to DS Mesh - Converts Rhino meshes to Design Script meshes., RH Nurbs Surface to DS Nurbs Surface - converts rhino nurbs surfaces to design script nurbs surfaces, RH NurbsCurve to DS NurbsCurve - Converts Rhino Nurbs Curves to Design Script Nurbs Curves. , RH Point to DS Point - Converts Rhino point object to Design Script point., RH PolyCurve to DS PolyCurve  - Converts Rhino polycurves to Design Script Polycurves., RH Polyline to DS Polycurve - Converts Rhino polyline curve to Design Script polycurve., Specify RhinoCommon.dll Path - This node needs to be used to specify a valid RhinoCommon.dll path. After it was used for the first time, you will not have to use it again, unless a new version of Mantis Shrimp or Rhino is installed., Write GH File - This node exports Dynamo (Design Script) geometry/data to Grasshopper.","engine_version":"1.3.2.2480","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["MantisShrimp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
